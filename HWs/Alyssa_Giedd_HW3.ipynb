    "The overly cautious algorithm (my algorithm) is better for the zoo due as it allows fewer birds to escape. As we've stated previously, humans being trapped in the aviary for a few seconds is less costly than losing birds.\n",

    "These algorithms can be converted by using the ratios in the original table with the new ratios. Here, for the top right corner of the old algorithm we can demonstrate: $\\frac{5}{52} = \\frac{x}{1}$, where x is the value to be intepreted into the new table, 52 comes from the original correct number of people, 5 comes from the original number of incorrect identifications, and 1 is the number of real people we have in the new context. Solving for x we find $x = 0.096$ We can repeat this process for every value in the table:\n",
